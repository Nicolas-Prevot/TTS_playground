## Setup Instructions

1. Start by instanciating your Conda environment by running the following command:

    ```sh
    conda env create -v -f environment.yml --force
    conda activate tts_playground
    ```

2. Install project dependencies with Poetry:

    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

3. Check current environment health:

    ```sh
    poetry check
    # >>> All set!
    ```

4. Declare any additional dependency automatically in the `pyproject.tmol` file by running the command:

    ```sh
    poetry add <pachage>
    poetry add <pachage>@<^version>  # If version is 2.0.5 then allow >=2.0.5, <3.0.0 versions
    poetry add "<pachage>>=<version>"  # No upper bound
    poetry add <pachage>==<version>  # Allow only selected version
    ```

    ex:

    ```sh
    poetry add numpy
    poetry add torch torchvision torchaudio --source pytorch
    ```
